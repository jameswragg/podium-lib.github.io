We are very happy to release version 4.0.0 of Podium. Both `@podium/layout` and
`@podium/podlet` are now available as version 4.0.0.

Version 4.0.0 is backwards compatible with version 3.0.0.

This release contain the following changes:

### JSON Schema

The manifest which defines the contract between Layouts and Podlets are now
defined as a [JSON Schema](https://github.com/podium-lib/schemas/blob/master/lib/manifest.schema.json). The main reason for this is to cater for implementations
in other languages than node.js.

### Document template

This version introduces a concept we call a document template. A document
template is intended to hold the part which the surrounding  `<HTML>`, `<HEAD>`
and `<BODY>` of where one will place content.

Document templates can be custom made and plugged into both Layouts and Podlets
with the intent of making it possible to develop on Podlets in isolation with
the same constraints it will have when included in a Layout.

Please see the [document template](/docs/next/api/document) section for further
info.

### HTTP framework free

Originally Podium was bound to Express.js but with this release Podium is 100%
HTTP framework free. It is fully possible to use Podium with plain node.js http
server module.

Though; Express.js is first class in Podium making it possible to use Podium in
an Express.js server without any more than the core modules.

Beside supporting Express.js, Hapi and Fastify are supported through plugins by
the Podium project.

Support for Serverless / cloud functions are on the road map.

### Multiple assets support

Previously one could only set one reference to JavaScript and CSS assets by the
`.js()` and `.css()` methods in `@podium/podlet`.

These does now support being called multiple times to set multiple assets.

The `.js()` method has also got a `type` attribute making it possible to flag
what type of JavaScript file it is.

### Layout assets

The `@podium/layout` module now has a `.js()` and `.css()` method which work the
same way as in `@podium/podlet` but with the intent to be able to set assets
which is related to the Layout.

### HttpIncoming replaces context argument

During the rewrite to become HTTP framework free, a `HttpIncoming` object which
is passed between the different parts in Podium has been introduced.

You can read more about [`HttpIncoming` and its role here](/docs/next/api/incoming).

Due to this, the `.client.fetch()` and `.client.stream()` methods in
`@podium/layout` prefer that `HttpIncoming` is passed in as first argument
instead of the context.

In other words; previously one would do like this:

```js
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    const ctx = res.locals.podium.context;
    const content = await podlet.fetch(ctx);
    ...
});
```

This will still work until Podium version 5 but now one should do like this:

```js
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    const incoming = res.locals.podium;
    const content = await podlet.fetch(incoming);
    ...
});
```

The context is part of `HttpIncoming`.

### Retrieving Podlets resolvs with an response object

When a Layout retrieves the content from a Podlet it will now resolve with a
Response object instead of just the content as a string.

Previously calling `.client.fetch()` would yeld the content of a Podlet as
a string:

```js
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    const incoming = res.locals.podium;
    const content = await podlet.fetch(incoming);
    console.log(content);  // <div> .... </div>
});
```

Now this will yeld an response object with the Podlets content, css, js and
headers:

```js
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    const incoming = res.locals.podium;
    const content = await podlet.fetch(incoming);
    console.log(content);  // {js: [], css: [], headers: {}, content: '<div> .... </div>'}
});
```

For backwards compabillity, using the response in a template literal or a string
concationation will yeld the content as a string. This will still work until
Podium version 5.

```js
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    const incoming = res.locals.podium;
    const content = await podlet.fetch(incoming);
    console.log(`${content}`);  // <div> .... </div>
});
```

The `.client.stream()` works as before, but have gotten a `beforeStream` event
which emits a response object:

```js
app.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
    const incoming = res.locals.podium;

    const stream = component.stream(incoming);
    stream.once('beforeStream', data => {
        console.log(data); // {js: [], css: [], headers: {}, content: null}
    });

    stream.pipe(res);
});
```

### State events

The `.client` in `@podium/layout` now has an extended `state` event and `.state`
property one can use to determine what state a Layout are in.

```js
layout.client.on('state', state => {
    console.log(state);
});

const podlet = layout.client.register({
    uri: 'http://foo.site.com/manifest.json',
    name: 'foo',
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    const incoming = res.locals.podium;
    const content = await podlet.fetch(incoming);
    ...
});
```

The state provides information about the "Podlet update life cycle". This is
usefull for determining when a Podlet is being updated and when a update is
done or if a Podlet are in an unhealty state.

### Improved documentation

In the process of making Podium HTTP framework free and supporting multiple
HTTP framework our documentation site have gotten an brush up.

This site will now hold all documentation for end users of Podium and it should
have code examples reflecting all HTTP frameworks which is officially supported.

From now on, the documentation found in the README's in each module is to be
considered documentation for developing Podium and not end user documentation.
