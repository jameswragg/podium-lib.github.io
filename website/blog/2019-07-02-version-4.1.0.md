Version 4.1.0 of `@podium/layout` and `@podium/podlet` are now available.

### Assets

This release contain some minor changes to the `.js()` and `.css()` methods in
both `@podium/layout` and `@podium/podlet` which paves ground for work we are
doing to improve asset handling and bundling when building microfrontends with
Podium.

The changes are:

Currently `.js()` and `.css()` returns its target value when called. This is
now deprecated and the methods will in close future not have a return value.

If you are doing stuff like this:

```js
app.get(podlet.js({ value: '/assets.js' }), (req, res) => {
    res.status(200).sendFile('./src/js/main.js', err => {});
});
```

You should rewrite it to do as follow:

```js
app.get('/assets.js', (req, res) => {
    res.status(200).sendFile('./src/js/main.js', err => {});
});

podlet.js({ value: '/assets.js' });
```

In addition to this `.js()` and `.css()` can now take an array of options
objects so its possible to set multiple assets in one go.

```js
app.use('/assets', express.static('./src/js'));

podlet.js([
    { value: '/assets/main.js' },
    { value: '/assets/extra.js' },
]);
```

We will write more about our work on asset handling and bundling when we have
some more concrete code to show.

### Proxy

This release does also contain a small fix to the proxy preventing it from
resolving a proxy request as successfull after a failed proxy request occured.

This mostly affected metrics causing failed proxy requests to also be counted
as successfull requests.
